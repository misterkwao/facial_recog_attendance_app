# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/adminlogin.jpeg
    - assets/images/adminlogin2.jpeg
    - assets/images/loginlottie.json
    - assets/images/admin.json
    - assets/images/splash.json
    - assets/images/student_profile.json
    - assets/images/lecturer.json
    - assets/images/student.json
    - assets/images/loginhalf.svg
    - assets/images/cloudloading.gif
    - assets/images/Warning.gif
    - assets/images/Classroom.png
    - assets/images/facial-recognition-icon.png
    - assets/images/pincode.gif
    - assets/images/privatedata.gif

    - assets/images/facialrecog.gif
    - assets/images/login.json
    - assets/images/map.gif
    - assets/images/logo.png
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Kanit
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Kanit-Bold.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
    - family: Prompt
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Prompt-ExtraBold.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
  #         style: italic
    - family: Montserrat Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Bold.ttf

    - family: Montserrat SemiBoldItalic
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-SemiBoldItalic.ttf
